## Introduction

CleanBlog is a small open-source project for a simple blog, created from scratch using HTML, CSS, Firebase JS, and QuillJS (a rich text editor library). This project aims to provide a minimalist approach to building a blog without the overhead of frameworks, retaining the essence of simplicity and learning.

## Features

- **Simple and clean design**
- **User authentication with Firebase**
- **FireStore integration with Firebase**
- **FireStorage integration with Firebase**
- **Rich text editing with QuillJS**
- **Responsive layout for desktop**
- **Tagging**
- **No frameworks, just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a modern web browser installed.
- You have a Firebase account and project set up.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CleanBlog.git
    cd CleanBlog
    ```

2. **Open the project in your code editor:**

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

3. **Set up Firebase:**

    - Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console.
    - Copy your Firebase configuration settings.
    - Replace the placeholder configuration in `firebase-config.js` with your Firebase project details.

### Usage

1. **Open `index.html` in your browser:**

    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

2. **Start blogging:**

    - Use the rich text editor to create and edit your blog posts.
    - Posts are automatically saved to and loaded from Firebase.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the blog.
- **JavaScript**: For functionality and interactivity.
- **Firebase**: For real-time database and hosting.
- **QuillJS**: For rich text editing.

## Why No Framework?

In this project, we intentionally avoided using frameworks to:

- **Maintain simplicity**: Frameworks can add unnecessary complexity for small projects.
- **Enhance learning**: Building from scratch helps understand the fundamentals of web development.
- **Improve performance**: No extra overhead means faster load times and better performance.
- **Preserve control**: Direct control over the code allows for more customized solutions.

Many small projects use frameworks, which can obscure the underlying principles of web development. By sticking to plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we retain the purity and simplicity of coding.
